# R_Training
Training material for tidyverse

## Content Purpose
This training was developed to reinforce the learning of R, in conjunction with online modules where the content is discussed with the trainees.
<br>The notes from the online modules are captured in a learnr script, which allows the trainees to have a copy of the notes from module, as well as a copy of all the exercises, and additional exercises for them to test their knowledge.
<br>This also allows for them to revisit the learning after the course has finished, as some trainees may be infrequent users of R.

# Required Packages
learnr
